(node:12196) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///D:/pv/DB/postcss.config.js?t=1767912480577 is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to D:\pv\DB\package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
